    "In general, data science allows us to adopt four different strategies to explore the world using data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Probing reality.* Data can be gathered by passive or by active methods. In the latter case, data represents the response of the world to our actions. Analysis of those responses can be extremely valuable when it comes to taking decisions about our subsequent actions. One of the best examples of this strategy is the use of A/B testing for web development: What is the best button size and color? The best answer can only be found by probing the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *Pattern discovery.* Divide and conquer is an old heuristic used to solve complex problems; but it is not always easy to decide how to apply this common sense top roblems. Datified problems can be analyzed automatically to discover useful patterns and natural clusters that can greatly simplify their solutions. The use of this technique to profile users is a critical ingredient today in such important fields as programmatic advertising or digital marketing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *Predicting future events.* Since the early days of statistics, one of the most important scientific questions has been how to build robust data models that are capable of predicting future data samples. Predictive analytics allows decisions to be taken in response to future events, not only reactively. Of course, it is not possible to predict the future in any environment and there will always be unpredictable events; but the identification of predictable events represents valuable knowledge. For example, predictive analytics can be used to optimize the tasks planned for retail store staff during the following week, by analyzing data such as weather, historic sales, traffic conditions, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *Understanding people and the world.* This is an objective that at the moment is beyond the scope of most companies and people, but large companies and governments are investing considerable amounts of money in research areas such as understanding natural language, computer vision, psychology and neuroscience. Scientific understanding of these areas is important for data science because in the end, in order to take optimal decisions, it is necessary to know the\n",
    "real processes that drive peopleâ€™s decisions and behavior. The development of deep learning methods for natural language understanding and for visual object recognition is a good example of this kind of research."
